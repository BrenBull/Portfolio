final_bbullock23 is the first game that I made, within the first year of learning coding. It is not a technical marvel, is very poorly built, but it was fun to make. 
Note if you want to run the game it only runs on an older Processsing version 4.0b1

The cabin images were the final project of my first semester of a digital media project. It is not complicated but what I could do in the given time frame.
The second semester of the digital media course was to create the visuals for final_bbullock23

Data analysis projects have been created, though cannot be displayed due to the sensative nature of the data itself, (NDA signed). The projescts
included "Analyzing and organing large donor datasets for regional community foundation and Produced graphs and tables from statistical analysis and
linear regression in response to queries from staff"
